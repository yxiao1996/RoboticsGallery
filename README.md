2. rendezvous: formation control in different settings;
3. walker: trajectory optimization for a 3-link simple walker;

### Dependencies

1. OptimTraj: to run all trajectory optimization toys, you need the MATLAB library. can be found here: https://github.com/MatthewPeterKelly/OptimTraj
2. Hungarian Algorithm for Linear Assignment Problems(V2.3): to run role assignment with formation control, you need this library to perform the Hungarian Algorithm. can be found here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20652-hungarian-algorithm-for-linear-assignment-problems-v2-3


Wish you having a good time with these toys.
